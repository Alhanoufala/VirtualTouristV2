# VirtualTouristV2 - Udacity Final Nanodegree project

The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr API. The app allows users to drop pins on a map. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures and the association of the pictures with the pin. Users shall be able to delete pins after adding them to the map. Users shall be able to switch to dark, light or system mood. In addition to the images downloaded from Flickr API for the specific location, users shall be able to see the weather information downloaded from OpenWeather API.
